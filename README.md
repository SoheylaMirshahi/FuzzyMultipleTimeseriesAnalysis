Analysing the relation among global stocks with a fuzzy model

In the research , using a fuzzy mathematical model we analyze the relation among multiple stocks and describe their interrelation in natural sentences. Two main theories: F-transform and fuzzy natural logic are the core of our analysis. The suggested method consist of two main steps, first using F-transform we smoothing the time series and extract their trend-Cycle. afterwards, we evaluate their similarities in different lags and provide a linguistic description of their interrelations. A python package is developed to fully automatize the suggested method, using that the method is tested on 24 stocks from 5 different regions.

## Getting Started

The code is written in python version 3, using Jupyter notebooks as it is available in the repository.

## Easy way

You can directly fork this repository on Google Colab engine by using this link:

## Normal way

### Prerequisites

Libraries used in the project are specified in the requirements.txt
after cloning the project you can install them all in once using the command:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
all necessary libraries will be installed .

alternatively, if you are using anaconda you should run the command:
conda install -r requirements.txt

### Running the code
